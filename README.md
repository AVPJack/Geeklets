My Geeklets
========

Check out [the screenshot](https://github.com/allusis/geeklets/blob/master/Screenshot.png) file for an example


Everything should load up all pretty as long as you have GeekTool installed and working properly, but you will have to change the path to the image for the Weather Icon to your own. 

It should look something like this: 

    file://PATH/TO/FOLDER/Geeklets/Weather/White/ 

you'll want to change "PATH/TO/FOLDER" to the actual path to your local folder when you pull this repo down, and you can choose either the black or the white folder depending on which one you'd like to use. Enjoy!
