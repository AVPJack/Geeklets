My Geeklets
========

Check out the [screenshot file](https://github.com/allusis/geeklets/blob/master/Screenshot.png) for an example

Everything should load up all pretty as long as you have [GeekTool 3.0.3](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/geektool/id456877552?l=fr&ls=1&mt=12) installed and working properly. Chances are these will work with most versions, but I haven't tested. 

## Features

**Some things you might want to know:**
* The files named *_Label.glet are the labels for each section. "System Uptime", "Memory Usage", "Wireless Devices", and "Volumes".
* The weather geeklets are in the /weather folder.
* The images can be displayed as black or white which can be set by pointing the geeklet at one of those folders.
* In order to get the weather icon to work you will have to change the path to the image to the actual path to your local folder. 
* The image path should look something like this in the Geeklets image URL field: 

    file://PATH/TO/FOLDER/Geeklets/Weather/White/
