Everything should load up all pretty as long as you have [GeekTool 3.0.3](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/geektool/id456877552?l=fr&ls=1&mt=12) installed and working properly. Chances are these will work with most versions, but I haven't tested. 

## Features

## Some things you might want to know:
* The files named *_Label.glet are the labels for each section. "System Uptime", "Memory Usage", "Wireless Devices", and "Volumes".
* The weather geeklets are in the /weather folder.
* In order to make sure you're pulling the right weather, you'll want to edit WeatherText. You can edit the geeklet file before you run it, or edit the script once opened.
* In order to use the conditions for your local area, you'll want to change <code>http://xml.weather.yahoo.com/forecastrss?p=90210&amp;u=c</code> to your zip code. Assuming your zip code is 13041, you should use the following: <code>http://xml.weather.yahoo.com/forecastrss?p=13041&amp;u=c</code>
* In order to get the weather icon to work you will have to change the path to your local icon folder in WeatherText geeklet. The image path by default looks like: <code>~/PATH/TO/Weather/$wtheme/$n.png</code>. You'll want to change it to reflect the local path to your icons. Assuming <code>/Documents/Geektool/Weather</code> is your local path, you should use the following: <code>~/Documents/GeekTool/Weather/$wtheme/$n.png</code>
