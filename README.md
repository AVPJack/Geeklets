========

GeekTool Geeklets are a nice way to show some extra / sassy things on your OSX desktop. 

Check out Screenshot.png file for an example


Everything should load up all pretty as long as you have GeekTool installed and working properly, but you will have to change the path to the image for the Weather Icon to your own. It should look something like this: file://PATH/TO/FOLDER/Geeklets/Weather/White/ and you'll want to change "PATH/TO/FOLDER" to the actual path to your local folder when you pull this repo down. Enjoy!
